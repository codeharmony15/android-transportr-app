See down below for more detailed explanations.

- use the location as a start or end of a trip query.

## Data usage

### Transport information providers

When searching for a trip, the entered data (trip details, your IP address and the fact you are using Transportr) will be available to the local transport provider you selected. For more information about how the selected transport provider stores your data, check their privacy policies.

### Map tiles

The map tiles are retrieved from the Mapbox API. The data they receive about you when downloading the map is your IP address, the location for which you download the map (which might or not be your current location) and the fact you are using Transportr. For more information about how Mapbox uses your data, check their [privacy policy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy).
